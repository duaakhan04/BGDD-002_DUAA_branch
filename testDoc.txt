My Ambition:
My ambition is to become a game designer, as I believe it aligns with my passions and strengths. From a young age,
I have been fascinated by games and creating new things. This interest has only grown over the years, motivating
me to work hard and improve my skills. I believe that ambition is not just about personal success but also about
making a positive impact on others. Through my chosen path, I hope to contribute to society and inspire those 
around me. Some individuals work tirelessly to achieve their dreams but forget to rest, leading to stress and
exhaustion. Others may take shortcuts, compromising their morals to reach their goals faster. My goal is to lead
through discipline, patience, and a sense of responsibility.
